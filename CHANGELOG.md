# Changelog

This CHANGELOG summarizes public releases. Full release notes are published with
GitHub Releases and mirrored in `docs/release-notes/`.

## Releases

- [v0.2.0](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/siftwire/releases/tag/v0.2.0)
  renames OpenBrief to Siftwire, ports the runtime to Rust under strict lint
  rules, documents the JSON process contract, preserves the SQLite schema, and
  adds explicit old-database migration tripwires.
- [v0.1.8](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.8)
  adds `record_delivery` delivery-history output and a ready-to-send final
  answer so agents can return the current brief plus two prior deliveries
  without reconstructing history from large `run_brief` payloads.
- [v0.1.7](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.7)
  fixes previous-brief rendering guidance so recorded previous brief bodies keep
  their Markdown links, strengthens regression coverage for the history eval,
  and refreshes maintainer workflow instructions from the OpenClerk template.
- [v0.1.6](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.6)
  adds previous-brief context to brief runner JSON, splits runner and SQLite
  internals into smaller testable modules, broadens skill validation coverage,
  and records taste-review and candidate-surface decisions for future
  OpenBrief workflow work.
- [v0.1.5](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.5)
  improves feed canonicalization fallback behavior, memoizes duplicate Google
  News article resolution within a brief run, and backs off Google News
  resolution after rate limits or timeouts without changing the runner CLI or
  install flow.
- [v0.1.4](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.4)
  adds a SQLite-backed `max_delivery_items` brief option, exposes the resolved
  limit in runner JSON, updates the production skill to honor it, and adds a
  targeted production-agent eval for configured delivery limits.
- [v0.1.3](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.3)
  bounds feed URL canonicalization work, preserves feed item ordering during
  parallel resolution, and makes RSS source outlet extraction effective for
  outlet policy matching without changing the runner CLI or install flow.
- [v0.1.2](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.2)
  allows user-directed legacy automation/config migration through a reviewed
  draft-and-apply OpenBrief skill workflow and hardens skill markdown
  validation tests without changing runner behavior.
- [v0.1.1](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
  refines the public OpenBrief skill display name and production runner-bypass
  refusal policy without changing runner behavior.
- [v0.1.0](https://github.com/yazanabuashour/openbrief/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
  is the first public release of the local-first OpenBrief runner and skill.
