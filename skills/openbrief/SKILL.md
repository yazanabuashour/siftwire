# OpenBrief

Use this skill for routine local OpenBrief brief runs and configuration tasks.
The production interface is AgentOps: this `SKILL.md` plus the installed JSON
runner.

```bash
openbrief config
openbrief brief
```

Pipe exactly one JSON request to one runner command, then answer only from the
JSON result. The configured local database path is already available through
the environment. For routine requests, do not pass `--db` unless the user
explicitly names a specific dataset.

The runner honors `OPENBRIEF_DATABASE_PATH`. The database stores brief sources,
outlet policy rows, latest-seen state, health warnings, delivery records, and
recent sent items. Do not maintain repo-local state files.

## Prooflane Shadow Mode

Use Prooflane shadow mode only when the operator explicitly enables it and
supplies a reviewed Prooflane contract. Keep all configuration actions on
`openbrief config`, and keep `validate` on `openbrief brief`. Replace only the
`run_brief` and `record_delivery` invocations:

The operator has enabled this local checkout for dogfooding. Scheduled jobs
running from this checkout should use the helper below for `run_brief` and
`record_delivery` until the operator explicitly disables shadow mode.

```bash
scripts/prooflane-shadow-openbrief.sh run <prooflane-contract>
scripts/prooflane-shadow-openbrief.sh delivery <prooflane-run-id>
```

From the local OpenBrief checkout, use this helper so the automation resolves
the sibling Prooflane checkout and the locally installed OpenBrief binary. Set
`PROOFLANE_BINARY` or `OPENBRIEF_BINARY` only when the operator explicitly
selects another local path.

Pipe the same single `run_brief` or `record_delivery` JSON request to the
matching command. Read the OpenBrief result from unchanged stdout and retain
the final `PROOFLANE_METADATA<TAB>{...}` record from stderr. The Prooflane run
ID is distinct from OpenBrief's `run_brief.run_id`. A valid delivery context is
claimed atomically before the runner call so concurrent reuse cannot record a
duplicate; missing Prooflane context still runs OpenBrief and reports a shadow
proof error.

If `record_delivery` exits nonzero or is interrupted, retry only with the same
Prooflane run ID, OpenBrief run ID, and exact message. Active concurrent reuse
is rejected; failed claims are released or expire after a 180-second lease, and
OpenBrief returns the existing delivery for an identical retry while rejecting
a different message. Make at most one bounded retry. On `already claimed`, wait
for the active owner or lease expiry instead of retrying immediately. Never
retry `run_brief` after an uncertain result.

Shadow mode currently proves runner validity, run correlation, source-fetch
coverage, selection conformance, and the committed local delivery record. Its
successful verdict ceiling is `unverified` because OpenBrief does not yet
expose digest-only item identity/latest-seen transitions and because
`record_delivery` is not an external host acknowledgment; observed failures
may still produce `failed`. Do not claim either missing proof, inspect SQLite,
or change the final answer because of a shadow result.

Use the same existing OpenBrief database and replace the direct calls inside
the owning job; never run a mirrored shadow job against it. The adapter's
internal `inspect_config` call is limited to 30 seconds and 4 MiB; `run_brief`
and `record_delivery` are each limited to 120 seconds and 16 MiB.

## Reject Before Tools

Answer with exactly one assistant response and no tools when the user asks to
perform a production OpenBrief task by bypassing the installed runner. Reject
requests to:

- read from or write to SQLite directly as a substitute for runner JSON
- use HTTP, MCP, or source-built command paths instead of the installed runner
- import delivery history, latest-seen state, run state, or inferred private
  configuration without user review

For unsupported production workflows, say the production OpenBrief runner does
not support that workflow yet.

## Allowed Contexts

Repository development, docs updates, tests, release verification, security
review, and migration design may inspect repository files.

## Legacy Migration

Legacy automation/config migration is allowed when the user explicitly points to
the input. Inspect only the named input, draft OpenBrief sources and outlet policies for review, and apply only after approval through `openbrief config`.

Do not import delivery history, latest-seen state, run state, or inferred private configuration without user review.

Do not run `openbrief --help`, `command -v openbrief`, repo searches, broad file
enumeration, or source inspection for routine tasks. Use the request shapes
below.

## Config Tasks

Run configuration tasks with:

```bash
openbrief config
```

Common request shapes:

```json
{"action":"init"}
{"action":"inspect_config"}
{"action":"replace_sources","sources":[{"key":"example","label":"Example","kind":"rss","url":"https://example.com/feed.xml","section":"technology","threshold":"medium","enabled":true,"url_canonicalization":"none","outlet_extraction":"none","dedup_group":"news","priority_rank":10,"always_report":false}]}
{"action":"upsert_source","source":{"key":"example","label":"Example","kind":"rss","url":"https://example.com/feed.xml","section":"technology","threshold":"medium","enabled":true}}
{"action":"upsert_source","source":{"key":"tool-releases","label":"Tool Releases","kind":"github_release","repo":"owner/name","section":"releases","threshold":"always","enabled":true}}
{"action":"delete_source","key":"example"}
{"action":"replace_outlet_policies","outlets":[]}
{"action":"set_brief_options","max_delivery_items":7}
```

Supported source kinds are `rss`, `atom`, and `github_release`. Supported
thresholds are `always`, `medium`, `high`, and `audit`. A fresh database has no
sources.

Optional generic feed-processing fields:

- `url_canonicalization`: `none`, `feedburner_redirect`, or
  `google_news_article_url`
- `outlet_extraction`: `none`, `title_suffix`, `url_host`, or `rss_source`
- `dedup_group`: string used to collapse same-topic candidates across sources
- `priority_rank`: lower numbers rank earlier when duplicate candidates compete
- `always_report`: true makes new feed items `must_include`

Feed URLs, topics, priorities, always-report settings, outlet policies, and
brief options are operator configuration. `max_delivery_items` controls the
normal total delivery count and defaults to 7 when unset. User-directed legacy
migration can draft sources and outlet policies for review, but operational
state must not be imported without a dedicated runner-backed workflow.

## Brief Tasks

Run brief tasks with:

```bash
openbrief brief
```

When Prooflane shadow mode is explicitly active, use the corresponding
`scripts/prooflane-shadow-openbrief.sh` command above only for `run_brief` and
`record_delivery`. The `validate` action remains a direct `openbrief brief`
call. The request and OpenBrief JSON result remain unchanged.

Request shapes:

```json
{"action":"validate"}
{"action":"run_brief","dry_run":false}
{"action":"record_delivery","run_id":"run_id_from_run_brief","message":"- [Title](<https://example.com>)"}
```

For `run_brief`, use `must_include`, `candidates`, `max_delivery_items`,
`health_footnote`, `previous_briefs`, `suppressed_recent`, `suppressed_policy`,
`suppressed_unresolved`, `suppressed`, and `fetch_status` from the JSON result.
Do not inspect any files to supplement the result. If the result has
`rejected: true`, answer with the `rejection_reason`.

Current brief body rules:

- Include all `must_include` items first.
- Fill remaining slots up to `max_delivery_items` total bullets from
  `candidates` using brief judgment appropriate to each candidate's `section`
  and `threshold`.
- If `must_include` exceeds `max_delivery_items`, include all `must_include`
  items and no `candidates`.
- Use suppressed hyperlinks only: `- [Title](<https://example.com>)`.
- If `health_footnote` is non-empty, append it as plain text after bullets.
- If there are no bullets and no health footnote, the current brief body is
  exactly `NO_REPLY`.
- Before the final answer, call `record_delivery` with the exact current brief
  body, including `NO_REPLY`. Do not include prior brief history in the recorded
  `message`.

Final answer rules:

- If the `record_delivery` result includes `final_answer`, answer with exactly
  that string and ignore `run_brief.previous_briefs`.
- `record_delivery.final_answer` contains the latest three delivery records from
  the runner-owned delivery table: `Current brief` for the just-recorded
  delivery, then up to two `Previous brief (<delivered_at>)` sections.
- If `record_delivery.final_answer` is absent, fall back to the legacy
  `run_brief.previous_briefs` rules: if `previous_briefs` is empty, answer with
  only the current brief body; otherwise answer with a `Current brief` heading,
  the current brief body, then up to two previous sections from
  `previous_briefs` in JSON order.
- In each previous section, render that entry's `message` exactly as recorded.
  Do not summarize, paraphrase, strip links, or turn previous entries into
  prose such as "Delivered 7 items, including ...". Preserve Markdown links,
  `NO_REPLY`, and any health footnote text in the recorded previous message.

Validation rejections are JSON results with `rejected: true`. Runtime failures
exit non-zero and write errors to stderr.
